Concretely, for each molecule the model outputs 12 probabilities, one for each assay (e.g. NR-AR, SR-ARE, p53, etc.). At training time we use a binary cross-entropy loss (with masking for missing labels) over those 12 tasks, and at the end of each epoch we compute the ROC-AUC per task (then average) on the held-out
